## ⚔️ VEINER — Warrior for digital Freedom.

Welcome to my GitHub.  
I build, I break, I search.

## Who I Am

I’m not here to impress. I’m here to **create**, **protect**, and **disrupt** when needed.  
I work in silence. Anything you think you know about me online is **fake by design**.

I don’t waste time.  
And I don’t let others waste mine.

## What I Do

- **OSINT** — I find what others miss.  
- **Coding** — Tools, automations, scripts, exploits.  
- **Ethical Hacking** — I hit systems where they’re weakest — to strengthen them.  
- **Design** — Create what others can't.  
- **Demolition** — I eliminate the trash of this world.

Everything here is built with intent.  
Everything works as expected — or it gets deleted.

## My Purpose

> Protect people from cybercrimes.  
> Fight for privacy.  
> Defend digital freedom.

I don’t care about threats, trolling, or digital noise.  
I’ll ignore it. Block it. Move on.

## Rules

- Don’t ask stupid questions — Google exists.  
  I help people who help themselves.

- Don’t test me. I’m not interested in games.

## Tools You'll Find Here

Everything I share here serves a purpose —  
Whether it’s defense, education, or chaos **with control**.

---

**Think before you click.  
Respect the code.  
Respect the craft.**
